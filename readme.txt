A plugin that lets you easily embed videos from your KrunchLabs account into WordPress.

== Description ==

KrunchLabs Video for WP makes it easy for KrunchLabs users to add videos to their WordPress sites.

KrunchLabs uses Javascript to embed videos across the web. This Javascript is hosted on KrunchLabs' secure server and inserts the actual video player in your page.

This ensures both desktop and mobile users get a version of the player that works for them.

== Installation ==

1. Extract all files from the ZIP archive, making sure to keep the file structure intact.
2. Upload the `krunchlabs-video` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Embedding Videos =

1. From your [KrunchLabs Dashboard](https://krunchlabs.com/clients/) choose a video to embed.
2. Choose "WordPress Embed" and copy its embed code (i.e. `[krunch video="xyz"]`).
3. Paste it in any post or page.

== Screenshots ==
